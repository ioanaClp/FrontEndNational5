1.	What is an arrow function? 
•	An arrow function expression is a compact alternative to a traditional function expression, but is limited and can't be used in all situations.
•	Differences & Limitations:
o	Does not have its own bindings to this or super, and should not be used as methods.
o	Does not have new.target keyword.
o	Not suitable for call, apply and bind methods, which generally rely on establishing a scope.
o	Can not be used as constructors.
o	Can not use yield, within its body.

// Arrow Function Break Down

// 1. Remove the word "function" and place arrow between the argument and opening body bracket
(a) => {
  return a + 100;
}

// 2. Remove the body braces and word "return" -- the return is implied.
(a) => a + 100;

// 3. Remove the argument parentheses
a => a + 100;
